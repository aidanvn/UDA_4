## Assignment 4

### IMPORTANT NOTE:
The Jupyter notebook includes a code section that creates images from stock price data. It will create 2 files of 300MB and 2 files of 2GB. It is recommended to start running Part I and Part II of the code prior to reading the report. Part I and II of the notebook takes 30-45 minutes to run. Part III and IV take approxiamately 15 minutes.

### Running the code
All the relevant code is contained in the Jupyter notebook and can be run chunk-by-chunk.

### Hardware
All the code was run on a laptop.

### Notation of tables, figures, output
All tables, figures, and outputs are labeled in the report. Within the notebook, the corresponding code chunk that generated the table/figure/output contains a comment "# table 1" / "# figure 1" / "# output 1". It can easily be found using ctrl+F.
